# This is the LLM system context tool defining common behaviors and rules for our GraphQL server.

# - **IMPORTANT**: When querying for records or passing IDs between different operations, use a record's `internalID`, not `id` or `_id`. Frequently, `slug` can also be used.
# - When asking for the ID of a record, return the value of `internalID`, but just call it "id". Devs and other users know what this means.

query llmSystemContext {
  # Intentionally no-op-ish
  system {
    time
