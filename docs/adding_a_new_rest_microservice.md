## Adding a new Microservice to Metaphysics

Ideal place we want to be: You don't need to do this because you're using
GraphQL and Stitching your schema. However, if you need to add in a service
manually follow this guide.

Let's pretend we're mapping an API called `Three Body` which uses Gravity to
generate a short-term JWT for your app.

1. Add your ENV Vars:

   ```sh
   THREE_BODY_APP_ID="xxx_gravity_app_id_xxx"
   THREE_BODY_API_BASE="https://threebody-staging.artsy.net/api"
   THREE_BODY_GEMINI_TEMPLATE="three-body-submission"
   ```

   These will need to be added to : Your `.env`, `.env.example`, `.env.test` and
   the live environments, as well as included in `./src/config.js`

1. Create an API: `lib/apis/threeBody.js`

   This is function which is used for any API call to your service. Depending on
   what you want to map, it should probably look like this if you have
   mutations:

   ```js
   import { assign } from "lodash"
   import fetch from "./fetch"
   import config from "config"

   const { THREE_BODY_API_BASE } = config

   export default (path, accessToken, fetchOptions = {}) => {
     const headers = {}
     if (accessToken)
       assign(headers, { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` })
     return fetch(
       `${THREE_BODY_API_BASE}/${path}`,
       assign({}, fetchOptions, { headers })
     )
   }
   ```

   Or this if you're only reading:

   ```js
   import fetch from "./fetch"
   const { THREE_BODY_API_BASE } = config

   export default path => fetch(`${THREE_BODY_API_BASE}/${path}`)
   ```

1. Create an API loader factory: `lib/loaders/api/index.js`

   This links the API calls to a loader, which ensures that all API requests to
   the same service are cached correctly. It should look something like:

   ```diff
   import positron from "lib/apis/positron"
   + import threeBody from "lib/apis/threeBody"

   ...

   + export const threeBodyLoaderWithAuthenticationFactory = apiLoaderWithAuthenticationFactory(threeBody)
   ```

1. Create a loader for your service:
   `lib/loaders/loaders_with_authentication/threeBody.js`

   Roughly, this looks something like:

   ```js
   import {
     gravityLoaderWithAuthenticationFactory,
     threeBodyLoaderWithAuthenticationFactory,
   } from "../api"

   const { THREE_BODY_APP_ID } = config

   export default accessToken => {
     let threeBodyTokenLoader
     const gravityAccessTokenLoader = () => Promise.resolve(accessToken)
     const threeBodyAccessTokenLoader = () =>
       threeBodyTokenLoader().then(data => data.token)

     const gravityLoader = gravityLoaderWithAuthenticationFactory(
       gravityAccessTokenLoader
     )
     const threeBodyLoader = threeBodyLoaderWithAuthenticationFactory(
       threeBodyAccessTokenLoader
     )

     // This generates a token with a lifetime of 1 minute, which should be plenty of time to fulfill a full query.
     threeBodyTokenLoader = gravityLoader(
       "me/token",
       { client_application_id: THREE_BODY_APP_ID },
       { method: "POST" }
     )

     return {
       groupResultsLoader: threeBodyLoader(id => `/group/${id}`),
     }
   }
   ```

   Each of which corresponds to one API call:
   `[THREE_BODY_API_BASE]/group/[id]`. You would add more API loaders at the to
   the `return`ed object as you add more routes to metaphysics.

1. Next you need to expose those loaders to the `rootValue` so you can access
   them in the resolvers, you can do that by editing
   `/lib/loaders/loaders_with_authentication/index.js` to add the following:

   ```diff
   import convectionLoaders from "./convection"
   + import threeBodyLoaders from "./threeBody"
   import impulseLoaders from "./impulse"

   ...convectionLoaders(accessToken),
   + ...threeBodyLoaders(accessToken),
   ...impulseLoaders(accessToken, userID),
   ```

1. If you have variables that clients might need to know that can differ between
   staging/production systems, you can extend the `services` object to include
   these variables so that each client does not need to hardcode the variables.

   Add an object that resolves to a process ENV var. Anything you expose will be
   available to the public, so don't put secrets in here.

   ```js
   // @ts-check
   import { GraphQLNonNull, GraphQLString, GraphQLObjectType } from "graphql"

   const ThreeBodySchema = new GraphQLObjectType({
     name: "ThreeBody",
     fields: () => ({
       threeBodyTemplateKey: {
         type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString),
       },
     }),
   })

   const ThreeBody = {
     type: ThreeBodySchema,
     description: "The schema for Three Body's ENV settings",
     args: {},
     resolve: () => ({
       threeBodyTemplateKey: config.THREE_BODY_GEMINI_TEMPLATE,
     }),
   }

   export default ThreeBody
   ```

   Then add a reference to this in `/schema/services/index.js`.

From here you need to handle the usual work of adding mutations for writing
data, and updating the schema for reading data. Good luck!
