# Metaphysics

Metaphysics is a [GraphQL](http://graphql.org)-compliant API that wraps various
Artsy APIs. You can [try it here](https://metaphysics-staging.artsy.net/)
against our staging API.

It is built on `express`, `express-graphql`, and `graphql`. With `graphiql`
providing a sandbox to work with.

It is currently used in production all over the place in
[Artsy.net](http://github.com/artsy/force/), and the
[Artsy iOS App](http://github.com/artsy/eigen)

### Getting Setup

To get yourself set up with all the project's dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics
cd metaphysics

# Install node modules
yarn install
# Installed system tools (like cache servers)
brew bundle
# Get set up with a default env
cp .env.oss .env
```

For Artsy staff wanting to expand on your `.env`, you can use `hokusai staging env get` to see staging's env vars. Or better yet, use [copy_env][] to match
staging:

[copy_env]: https://github.com/jonallured/copy_env

```
$ copy_env hokusai
```

That command will dump the env vars from staging and do a find/replace on the
keys from staging that are listed as REPLACE in the example file.

### Development

With your dependencies set up, you can run Metaphysics by running:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Which will start the server on http://localhost:5001

_Recommended:_ You can run the commands inside the terminal in VS Code, then the
debugger will be hooked up by default.

### Setting up your local GraphiQL

We recommend the [graphiql.app](https://github.com/skevy/graphiql-app) client
for testing queries locally.

You will need to set up headers with both:

- `x-access-token` - Open https://staging.artsy.net, sign in and evaluate `sd.CURRENT_USER.accessToken` in a dev console _(CMD+Shift+C in Chrome)_.
- `x-user-id` - As above, but `sd.CURRENT_USER.id`.

_If you're new to GraphQL, you can checkout [Artsy's GraphQL Workshop](https://github.com/artsy/graphql-workshop)._

### Sample Queries

Once you have the GraphiQL client running against your local service,
you can verify things are working by executing these queries:

#### Get popular artists

```
{
  popular_artists {
    artists {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

#### Get your account information

```
{
  me {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

If any of these queries fail, it's probable that you misconfigured your
`x-access-token` or `x-user-id` HTTP headers.

- [Adding a rest micro-service to Metaphysics](docs/adding_a_new_rest_microservice.md)

- [GraphQL Schema Design][]

[graphql schema design]: https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/playbooks/graphql-schema-design.md

### Docker and Kubernetes setup

This is deployed using Hokusai to manage Docker and Kubernetes. To replicate
this:

- Install [Docker for Mac](https://github.com/artsy/hokusai#requirements) and
  [Hokusai](https://github.com/artsy/hokusai#setup)

  ```
  $ brew tap caskroom/cask && brew cask install docker
  $ pip install hokusai
  ```

  If you are using your system Python distribution, you may need to run this as:

  ```
  $ sudo pip install hokusai --ignore-installed
  ```

- Configure Hokusai

  ```
  $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={{ MY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
  $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={{ MY_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
  $ hokusai configure --kubectl-version {{ kubectl_version }} --s3-bucket {{ kubectl_config_s3_bucket }} --s3-key {{ kubectl_config_s3_key }}
  $ hokusai check
  ```

  Artsy staff should find follow the instructions in
  https://github.com/artsy/potential/blob/master/platform/Kubernetes.md#hokusai

### Testing

- Run tests in the Docker Compose test stack via Hokusai:

  ```
  $ hokusai test
  ```

- Or, to run tests locally: `npm test` to run the entire suite `npm run watch`
  to spin up the test watcher
